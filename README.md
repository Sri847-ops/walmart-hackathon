# 🌿 EcoCommerce - Sustainable E-commerce Platform

EcoCommerce is a sustainability-first e-commerce web app designed to encourage eco-friendly shopping habits. It integrates intelligent green score analysis, dynamic pricing based on expiry and inventory, and donation support for unsold or near-expiry items — helping both the planet and people.

## 🚀 Features

- ♻️ **Green Score Calculation**  
  Analyze the environmental impact of the cart items using Nebius AI Studio. Each product is scored based on packaging, shipping method, and sustainability of ingredients — scaled according to quantity.

- 🏷️ **Dynamic Pricing**  
  Prices are dynamically adjusted based on expiry dates and inventory levels. Closer to expiry = more discounts. Excess inventory = auto markdowns.

- ❤️ **Donation for Near-Expiry Items**  
  If a product is nearing expiry and hasn't been sold in sufficient quantity, the platform intelligently flags it for donation.

- 🛒 **Modern E-Commerce Cart Functionality**  
  Add/remove items, update quantities, view order summary, and calculate green score seamlessly.
